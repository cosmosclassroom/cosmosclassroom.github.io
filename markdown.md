# Welcome to My Physics Courses

Welcome to the official website for my **Physics Courses**! Here you will find resources for my physics, honors physics, astronomy, and honors biology classes. 

I believe in the power of scientific discovery, and this website is dedicated to helping students understand the world of physics through clear explanations, diagrams, and interactive content.

## Courses

- **Physics**  
[Microwave Screen][microwave]
   A foundational course that explores classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics.
  
- [**Honors Physics**](hphysics.html)  
   An advanced physics course with an emphasis on problem-solving and deeper theoretical understanding.
  
- **Astronomy**  
   Explore the universe, from the solar system to the farthest galaxies. Study the stars, planets, and the laws governing celestial bodies.
  
- **Honors Biology**  
   While not strictly physics, this course offers an understanding of biological systems through the lens of physics.

### Key Resources

- [Free-Body Diagrams](#) - Interactive visualizations to help you understand forces and motion.
- [LaTeX Solution Keys](#) - Solution keys formatted with LaTeX for calculations and problem-solving steps.
- [2D Linear and Circular Motion](#) - Reference frames and force vectors for complex motion problems.

### About Me

I am a passionate teacher with a deep love for the classics and natural sciences. My goal is to help students understand the foundational principles of physics and how they relate to our everyday lives and the universe around us.
